The student <em><b>C</b>ommunity <b>O</b>ut<b>R</b>each <b>P</b>andemic <b>S</b>ervice</em> are a group of preclerkship and clerkship medical and physician assistant (PA) students serving the community by acting as physician extenders for cliniciansduring the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This site and [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/MikeDacre/studentcorps) are intended to provide resources to departments, students, and clinicians who want to implement a wellness phone call system run by students to check on vulnerable patients, provide emotional support to them, and relay important information back to the health team.

Students are NOT intended to replace clinical care or clinical clerkships, but to supplement them during the pandemic, as clinical resources are stretched thin and patients are particularly vulnerable.

For more information about the model and the team behind it, please see the [about](/about) page.

## Getting Started

For example instructions on how to implement this program, see the **[instructions page](/instructions)**.

Clinicians or Departments, please see the [clinician/department resources](/instructions/#clinician-and-department-resources); students, please see the [student resources](/instructions/#student-resources).

# Instructions

Please see the instructions on the site [https://www.studentcorps.site/instructions](https://www.studentcorps.site/instructions). These instructions and the documents in this folder represent our best practices following our experiences so far, and will be updated frequently. If you have any suggestions for changes/additions, please [let us know](https://www.studentcorps.site/instructions/about/#contact).

*If you do implement such a program, please have volunteers fill out this survey prior to starting and after ending, or after two months, whichever comes first:*

*[https://mdd.li/studentcorpsstudy](https://mdd.li/studentcorpsstudy)*

*Then, after each call, please fill out the following, very short, post-call survey:*

*These will help us get an idea of who is using the idea, and what kind of impact it is having. Thanks!*

# Resources

All of the resources are `.docx` documents in the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/MikeDacre/studentcorps), it is highly recommended that you alter them to meet your practice environment.

You can download all the documents as a package here: https://github.com/MikeDacre/studentcorps/releases

The student ***C**ommunity **O**ut-**r**each **P**andemic **S**ervice* are a
group of preclinical and clinical medical and physician assistant (PA) students
serving the community by acting as physician extenders for providers during the
time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Students partner with providers to make follow up
calls to patients that the provider thinks may be potentially vulnerable in some
way, for example because they are older, live alone, or are experiencing
heightened anxiety due to the pandemic. Normally, providers would call these
patients back themselves, however COVID-19 cases have stretched medical
resources thin, making these wellness calls harder to execute. Medical and PA
students are largely excluded from clinical care at this time due to PPE
shortages and have the ability to work with clinicians to provide this follow up
and emotional support to potentially isolated patient, effectively extending the
reach of overtaxed clinicians.

Students do not provide any medical advice or medical care over the phone and
are not acting as medical providers in any way. They are instead simply
providing medical support and relaying any non-urgent questions or concerns from
patient to provider.

This repository will contain all the materials needed to start a clinican:student
partnership, including onboarding materials, example scripts, Epic templates,
and instructions on using Doximity and Epic for calls. The Epic templates and
instructions will likely need to be adapted for each environment, but everything
else should be transferrable.
